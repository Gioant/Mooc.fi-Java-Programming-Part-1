## About MOOC.fi Java Programming Course

MOOC.fi Java Programming is a course offered for free by the University of Helsinki. Anyone can join and take it. The best part is that no prior knowledge is required!

Even if you are an experienced programmer, I find the course worth taking if your Java skills need improvement or just looking for some practice.
Each lesson has its own exercises that you will need to answer along with some quizzes to help you retain key information that you have read.

The University of Helsinki launched their 2020 version of Java Programming Sometime this year, It is the updated version from their previously popular 2013 version.

You can find the course at: https://java-programming.mooc.fi/

## Course Contents

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes about 5-20 hours, and they recommend reserving at least 10 hours per part, depending on prior skills and knowledge of programming.

## About this Github Repo

I wanted a way to save the exercises and making it public for others to see. While also being able to look back and improve upon in the future. I find when one becomes more experienced they can look back at their beginning coding journey and laugh at some of their mistakes but also hopefully able to optimze it.

Each Exercised folder should have a picture in the readme file explaining the exercise that needs to be solved.

# F.A.Q

## The answers appear different and do not work from what you have, what gives?

I'm currently in the process of completing this course. I also started near the end of December 2020. There may have been bugs or fixes needed that were pushed out.

I'll try my best to update it.

## Where do the answers come from?

All the exercises come with the suggested answers you are shown after completing the assignment. Also, For each exercise you are given a template to work with.

However, you must conform to their specifications of their answer in order to pass the 'test' to successfully complete the exercises.


## Where can I see your solution to the exercises?

Go to any Exercices folder --> /src folder --> /main folder ---> /java . here you will see my version of the code to solve the exercise.
